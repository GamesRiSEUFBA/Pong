# Configuration Document

In this document, we'll describle the environment we use to work on Pong. Any version changes should be added here so we can be sure everyone is using the same tools.

Currently, the Unity release we use is **2017.2.0f3 Personal**. Work is preferably done with the Windows or Mac versions of Unity. The GNU/Linux client is currently in open beta.

By default, we'll use assets (sprites, sounds and backgrounds) from [Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org/). Assets from other sources may be used as long as they are available under a free license.
